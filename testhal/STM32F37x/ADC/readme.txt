** ChibiOS/RT HAL - ADC driver demo for STM32.                             **
*****************************************************************************

** TARGET **

The demo runs on an STM 32373C-EVAL

** The Demo **

The application demonstrates the use of the STM32 ADC driver to
read the STM 32373C-EVAL board PT100 temperature resistor 
using the STM32F373x SDADC.  This program was ported from
the STM 32373C eval board demo software.

** Build Procedure **

The demo has been tested using the ARM GCC-based toolchain.

** Notes **
